# Notes

- How to make a grid gameboard with the nested data? Table?
- How to smoothly transition views? Router or Animations? 
- How to move between rounds? Jeopardy, Double Jeopardy, final Jeopardy

- I think I'm a little bit out of my depth! To properly pass data, I need to set up the views before hand, and I don't really know how. I don't think this deadline is gonna be met by next Saturday, which is okay.

Lots to consider! MVC, Routing, etc.

My mini projects have helped me make websites with React, but I don't know how to make an _application_ with view transitions, etc.

- Question: 
  - Keep pushing with this project right now? OR
  - Consider this project as my main portfolio project to work on for now and work through React docs at least. Take a week to complete a React tutorial or work through RTR
  - Why this is a good project to take on pre-SGO
    - Less emotionally involved
    - Fewer users (though I can still be telling the truth when I say I use it with my friends â€“ still selfdogfood)
    - Less data to consider
    - More like a webapp, less like a website
    - Better design because it's ripped straight from Jeopardy/not my own brain
    - More considerate of UX, transitons, etc
    - Still considers user preferences (timer length, number of contestants, etc)
